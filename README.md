# SportsGraph Trade Visualization Tool
Ever wonder if the owners of various sports franchises are colluding to defeat some other owner?
Well I did, and I wanted to use Angular and D3 in a non-work project, and thus the 'SportsGraph Trade Visualization Tool' was born.
Still in very early stages, it is already fun to watch it work. Lots of dots flying around the screen. At the moment that is it ;)
